- **Blocks**: Block A, Block B across floors
- **Locations**: A101, A102 (lecture halls), B201 (computer lab), B202 (meeting room), E101 (engineering lab)

#### Step 5: Server Running ✅
- **Status**: Server is running successfully
- **URL**: `http://localhost:5130`
- **Swagger**: `http://localhost:5130/swagger`
- **Environment**: Development
- **Database**: Connected to MySQL `ResourcelyDB_Dev`

## 🧪 Ready for Testing!

### Quick Test URLs:
1. **API Documentation**: [http://localhost:5130/swagger](http://localhost:5130/swagger)
2. **Get Buildings**: `GET http://localhost:5130/api/buildings`
3. **Get Locations**: `GET http://localhost:5130/api/locations`

### Postman Testing:
- Use base URL: `http://localhost:5130`
- All API endpoints are ready for testing
- Sample data available for immediate testing

### Database Verification:
Connect to your MySQL server and check the `ResourcelyDB_Dev` database:
```sql
USE ResourcelyDB_Dev;
SHOW TABLES;
SELECT * FROM Buildings;
SELECT * FROM Users;
SELECT * FROM Locations;
```

## 🎯 What You Can Test Now:

### 🏢 Resource Management (Hierarchical)
- Create/view buildings
